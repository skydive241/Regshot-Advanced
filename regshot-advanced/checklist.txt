Important steps to take before a release:
=========================================

#0
- recommended folder structure on your disk:
  Regshot
   -> branches (NOT a working copy)
       -> X.Y.Z (working copy of a beta version)
   -> tags (NOT a working copy)
       -> X.Y.Z (working copy of a release version)
   -> trunk (working copy of latest developement)
  when checking out the branches or tags folder directly then all versions would be on your disk all the time
  by using a normal folder for "branches"/"tags" and checking out versions separately the working copies of uninteresting versions can be easily discarded

#1 Preparation
- clean up the repository: update the trunk working copy, commit tested changes, etc.
- check "files/ReadMe.txt" if nobody was forgotten concerning contributions, bugs fixes, and so on
- check the date, year and version in all .txt files
  (files/History.txt, files/ReadMe.txt)
- edit "src/version.rc.h" for the correct version number and copyright years
- edit "src/res/Regshot.exe.manifest" for the correct version number
- commit changes

#2 Create a branch for beta phase
- copy the trunk to a new branch
  svn copy https://svn.code.sf.net/p/regshot/code/trunk https://svn.code.sf.net/p/regshot/code/branches/X.Y.Z -m "Branch X.Y.Z"
- the branch will be used to maintain bugfixes for this version

#3 Build beta from branch
- checkout branch in a new separate folder (this ensures nothing was forgotten in trunk to be committed)
  svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/regshot/code/branches/X.Y.Z
- edit all .txt files to reflect beta status
  (files/History.txt, files/ReadMe.txt)
- edit "src/version.rc.h" to set the correct version type "beta"
- commit changes
- build all builds with VS2008

#3 Tests
- test (shots & save, compare, clean, load, compare, clean, quit)
- test
- test

#4 Create a tag for release
- Tag the new version
  svn copy https://svn.code.sf.net/p/regshot/code/branches/X.Y.Z https://svn.code.sf.net/p/regshot/code/tags/X.Y.Z -m "Tag X.Y.Z"

#5 Build release from tag
- checkout tag in a new separate folder (this ensures nothing was forgotten in branch to be committed)
  svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/regshot/code/tags/X.Y.Z
- edit all .txt files to reflect release status
  (files/History.txt, files/ReadMe.txt)
- edit "src/version.rc.h" to set the correct version type "release"
- commit changes
- build all builds with VS2008
- final test

#6 Create zip packages
- use "make_packages.bat" to create release packages


If anything of the above fails, forget about a release and correct the errors first!
If it worked out ok, however, do a release!


#7 Release
- upload the zips to sourceforge.net
- shut down your computer! Go and have a drink. You deserve one now!
- 12 hours later, check back the tickets for the first terrible errors we forgot to fix!
