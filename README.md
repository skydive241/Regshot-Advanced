# Regshot advanced
**Regshot advanced** is a tool to monitor and log filesystem and registry changes for example done by an installer. Its main purpose is to detect things modified or added by tools running on windows systems.

Its use is very simple: do the first shot before e.g. an installer runs, do the second shot directly after installation, and last, compare the shots.

BUT **Regshot advanced** got a plethora of configuration possibilities and produces log files in various formats:
* Plain TXT files
* HTML files
* CMD files for undoing the changes
* An easy parsable text file called "UNL"
* REG files undoing or repeating the registry changes
* NSIS installer and uninstaller files, directly usable by the appropriate compiler
* Innosetup installer and uninstaller files, directly usable by the appropriate compiler
